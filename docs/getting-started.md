Getting started with the template is fairly easy. There are only a few number of steps as listed down below.

{% hint style="warning" %}

using [YARN](https://yarnpkg.com/) over NPM is recommened when using this template.

1\. Create react native app by providing`react-native-typescript-boilerplate` as a template.

```
npx react-native myapp --template https://github.com/abdulhamidOumer/react-native-typescript-boilerplate.git
```

2\. Get into the generated app's directory and explore the code and features.

```
cd myapp
yarn start
```

3\. Get started by setting your app icon or splash screen icon.

```
yarn set
```
